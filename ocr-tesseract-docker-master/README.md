# OCR Tesseract Docker
Allows upload of an image for OCR using Tesseract and deployed using Docker.  This uses Flask, a light weight web server framework - but for development purposes only.  OpenCV is used to reduce noise in the image for better processing by pytesseract.  Uploads on AWS are limited to 2MB - below are 3 images of a job posting taken on a Pixel 2XL phone, and reduced in size using Gimp by adjusting quality. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Docker installed on your system and a command line editor.

```
Docker
Git Bash (on Windows)
Terminal (Linux or Mac)
```

### Installing and Running

You can clone this repository or download a zip file, build and run the Docker image.

```
$ docker build -t ocr-tesseract-docker .
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ocr-tesseract-docker
```

OR you can pull and/or run the Docker image from my repository on Docker Hub

```
docker pull ricktorzynski/ocr-tesseract-docker
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 ricktorzynski/ocr-tesseract-docker
```
Then open up browser to http://localhost:5000

You can use these images to test it - these are photos of a job posting:

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Matt Berseth and Robert Marsh of NLP Logix for inspiring me to build this application - I have learned a great deal in a short amount of time.
